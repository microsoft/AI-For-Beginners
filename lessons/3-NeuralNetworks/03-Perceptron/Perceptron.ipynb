    " * We have leart about the simplest neural network architecture - one-layer perceptron.\n",

    " * Despite simplicity, one-layered perceptron can solve rather complex problems of handwritten digit recognition\n",
    " * One-layered perceptron is a liner classifier, and thus it provides the same classification power as logistic regression.\n",
    " * In the sample space, perceptron can separate two classes of input data using hyperplane."
