While pretrained embeddings can capture some of the meaning of words in context, every possible meaning of a word is encoded into the same embedding. This can cause problems in downstream models, since many words such as the word 'play' have different meanings depending on the context they are used in.\n",

To overcome this limitation, we need to build embeddings based on the **language model**, which is trained on a large corpus of text, and *knows* how words can be put together in different contexts. Discussing contextual embeddings is out of scope for this tutorial, but we will come back to them when talking about language models in the next unit.\n"
