**Yapay Zeka**, bilgisayarların nasıl akıllı davranışlar sergilemesini sağlayabileceğimizi inceleyen heyecan verici bir bilimsel disiplindir, ör. insanoğlunun yapmakta iyi olduğu şeyleri yapmak.

Başlangıçta bilgisayarlar [Charles Babbage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage) tarafından, iyi tanımlanmış bir prosedürü, yani bir algoritmayı izleyerek sayılar üzerinde çalışmak üzere icat edildi. Modern bilgisayarlar, 19. yüzyılda önerilen orijinal modelden önemli ölçüde daha gelişmiş olmasına rağmen, hala aynı kontrollü hesaplama fikrini takip ediyor. Bu nedenle, hedefe ulaşmak için yapmamız gereken adımların tam sırasını biliyorsak, bir bilgisayarı bir şeyler yapmak üzere programlamak mümkündür.

> ✅ Bir kişinin fotoğrafından yaşını belirlemek, açık şekilde programlanamayan bir iştir, çünkü bunu yaparken kafamızın içinde bir sayıyı nasıl bulduğumuzu bilmiyoruz.

---

Bununla birlikte, nasıl çözeceğimizi açıkça bilmediğimiz bazı görevler var. Bir kişinin yaşını fotoğrafından belirlemeyi düşünün. Bir şekilde yapmayı öğreniyoruz, çünkü farklı yaştaki birçok insan örneğini gördük, ancak bunu nasıl yaptığımızı açıkça ifade edemediğimiz gibi bilgisayarı da bunu yapmaya programlayamayız. Bu tam olarak **yapay zeka**nın (kısaca YZ) ilgisinde olan türden bir görevdir.

✅ Yapay zekadan yararlanabilecek bazı görevleri bir bilgisayara yükleyebileceğinizi düşünün. Finans, tıp ve sanat alanlarını düşünün - bu alanlar bugün yapay zekadan nasıl yararlanıyor?

## Zayıf YZ ve Güçlü YZ

Bir fotoğraftan bir kişinin yaşını belirleme gibi, belirli bir insani problemi çözme görevi, **zayıf YZ** olarak adlandırılabilir, çünkü bir insanın yapabileceği gibi birçok görevi çözebilecek bir sistem değil, yalnızca bir görev için bir sistem oluşturuyoruz. Tabii ki, genel olarak akıllı bir bilgisayar sistemi geliştirmek, bilinç felsefesi öğrencileri için olanlar da dahil olmak üzere birçok açıdan son derece ilginçtir. Bu tür bir sisteme **güçlü YZ** veya **[Genel Yapay Zeka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence)** (GYZ) adı verilir.

## Zekanın Tanımı ve Turing Testi

**[Zeka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence)** terimiyle uğraşırken karşılaşılan sorunlardan biri, bu terimin net bir tanımının olmamasıdır. Zekanın **soyut düşünme** veya **öz farkındalık** ile bağlantılı olduğu iddia edilebilir, ancak onu tam olarak tanımlayamıyoruz.

*Zeka* teriminin belirsizliğini görmek için şu soruyu yanıtlamayı deneyin: "Bir kedi zeki midir?". İddianın doğru olup olmadığını kanıtlarken evrensel olarak kabul edilmiş bir test olmadığı için, farklı insanlar bu soruya farklı cevaplar verme eğilimindedir. Fakat olduğunu düşünüyorsanız - kedinizi bir IQ testine sokmayı deneyin...

✅ Bir an için zekayı nasıl tanımladığınızı düşünün. Bir labirenti çözebilen ve yiyecek bir şeyler bulabilen bir karga zeki midir? Çocuk zeki midir?

---

GYZ hakkında konuşurken, gerçekten zeki bir sistem oluşturup oluşturmadığımızı anlamanın bir yolunu bulmamız gerekiyor. [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) **[Turing Testi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test)** diye adlandırılan bir yol önerdi, ki zekanın bir tanımı gibi de davranır. Test, belirli bir sistemi doğası gereği akıllı bir şeyle - gerçek bir insanla karşılaştırır ve herhangi bir otomatik karşılaştırma bir bilgisayar programı tarafından aşılabileceğinden, bir insan sorgulayıcı kullanırız. Yani, bir insan metin tabanlı diyalogda gerçek bir kişi ile bir bilgisayar sistemini ayırt edemiyorsa - sistem akıllı olarak kabul edilir.

> St.Petersburg'da geliştirilen [Eugene Goostman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Goostman) adlı bir sohbet botu, zekice bir kişilik numarası kullanarak 2014'te Turing testini geçmeye çok yaklaştı. Önce 13 yaşında Ukraynalı bir çocuk olduğunu söyledi, bu da metindeki bilgi eksikliklerini ve bazı tutarsızlıkları açıklayacaktı. Bot, Turing'in bir makinenin 2000 yılına kadar geçebileceğine inandığı bir ölçüm olan 5 dakikalık bir diyalogdan sonra değerlendiricilerin %30'unu insan olduğuna inandırdı. Ancak, bunun akıllı bir sistem yarattığımızı göstermediğini ya da bir bilgisayar sisteminin insan sorgulayıcıyı kandırmadığını anlamalıyız - sistem insanları kandırmadı, aksine bot yaratıcıları kandırdı!

✅ Hiç bir sohbet botu tarafından bir insanla konuştuğunuzu düşünerek kandırıldınız mı? Sizi nasıl ikna etti?

#gitYZ'ya Farklı Yaklaşımlar

If we want a computer to behave like a human, we need somehow to model inside a computer our way of thinking. Consequently, we need to try to understand what makes a human being intelligent.

> To be able to program intelligence into a machine, we need to understand how our own processes of making decisions work. If you do a little self-introspection, you will realize that there are some processes that happen subconsciously – eg. we can distinguish a cat from a dog without thinking about it - while some others involve reasoning.

There are two possible approaches to this problem:

Top-down Approach (Symbolic Reasoning) | Bottom-up Approach (Neural Networks)
---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------
A top-down approach models the way a person reasons to solve a problem. It involves extracting **knowledge** from a human being, and representing it in a computer-readable form. We also need to develop a way to model **reasoning** inside a computer. | A bottom-up approach models the structure of a human brain, consisting of huge number of simple units called **neurons**. Each neuron acts like a weighted average of its inputs, and we can train a network of neurons to solve useful problems by providing **training data**.

There are also some other possible approaches to intelligence:

* An **Emergent**, **Synergetic** or **multi-agent approach** are based on the fact that complex intelligent behaviour can be obtained by an interaction of a large number of simple agents. According to [evolutionary cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_brain#Evolutionary_cybernetics), intelligence can *emerge* from more simple, reactive behaviour in the process of *metasystem transition*.

* An **Evolutionary approach**, or **genetic algorithm** is an optimization process based on the principles of evolution.

We will consider those approaches later in the course, but right now we will focus on two main directions: top-down and bottom-up.

### The Top-Down Approach

In a **top-down approach**, we try to model our reasoning.  Because we can follow our thoughts when we reason, we can try to formalize this process and program it inside the computer. This is called **symbolic reasoning**.

People tend to have some rules in their head that guide their decision making processes. For example, when a doctor is diagnosing a patient, he or she may realize that a person has a fever, and thus there might be some inflammation going on inside the body. By applying a large set of rules to a specific problem a doctor may be able to come up with the final diagnosis.

This approach relies heavily on **knowledge representation** and **reasoning**. Extracting knowledge from a human expert might be the most difficult part, because a doctor in many cases would not know exactly why he or she is coming up with a particular diagnosis. Sometimes the solution just comes up in his or her head without explicit thinking. Some tasks, such as determining the age of a person from a photograph, cannot be at all reduced to manipulating knowledge.

### Bottom-Up Approach

Alternately, we can try to model the simplest elements inside our brain – a neuron. We can construct a so-called **artificial neural network** inside a computer, and then try to teach it to solve problems by giving it examples. This process is similar to how a newborn child learns about his or her surroundings by making observations.

✅ Do a little research on how babies learn. What are the basic elements of a baby's brain?

> | Part of Artificial Intelligence that is based on computer learning to solve a problem based on some data is called **Machine Learning**. We will not consider classical machine learning in this course - we refer you to a separate [Machine Learning for Beginners](http://aka.ms/ml-beginners) curriculum. |   ![ML for Beginners](images/ml-for-beginners.png)    |

## A Brief History of AI

Artificial Intelligence was started as a field in the middle of the twentieth century. Initially symbolic reasoning was a prevalent approach, and it led to a number of important successes, such as expert systems – computer programs that were able to act as an expert in some limited problem domain. However, it soon became clear that such approach does not scale well. Extracting the knowledge from an expert, representing it in a computer, and keeping that knowledgebase accurate turns out to be a very complex task, and too expensive to be practical in many cases. This led to so-called [AI Winter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter) in the 1970s.

As time passed, computing resources became cheaper, and more data has become available, so neural network approaches started demonstrating great performance in competing with human beings in many areas, such as computer vision or speech understanding. In the last decade, the term Artificial Intelligence has been mostly used as a synonym for Neural Networks, because most of the AI successes that we hear about are based on them.

We can observe how the approaches changed, for example, in creating a chess playing computer program:

* Early chess programs were based on search – a program explicitly tried to estimate possible moves of an opponent for a given number of next moves, and selected an optimal move based on the optimal position that can be achieved in a few moves. It led to the development of the so-called [alpha-beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning) search algorithm.
* Search strategies work well towards the end of the game, where the search space is limited by a small number of possible moves. However, in the beginning of the game the search space is huge, and the algorithm can be improved by learning from existing matches between human players. Subsequent experiments employed so-called [case-based reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case-based_reasoning), where the program looked for cases in the knowledge base very similar to the current position in the game.
* Modern programs that win over human players are based on neural networks and [reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning), where the programs learn to play solely by playing a long time against itself and learning from its own mistakes – much like human beings do when learning to play chess. However, a computer program can play many more games in much less time, and thus can learn much faster.

✅ Do a little research on other games that have been played by AI.

Similarly, we can see how the approach towards creating “talking programs” (that might pass the Turing test) changed:

* Early programs of this kind such as [Eliza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA), were based on very simple grammatical rules and the re-formulation of the input sentence into a question.
* Modern assistants, such as Cortana, Siri or Google Assistant are all hybrid systems that use Neural networks to convert speech into text and to recognize our intent, and then employ some reasoning or explicit algorithms to perform required actions.
* In the future, we may expect complete neural-based model to handle dialogue by itself. The recent GPT and [Turing-NLG](https://turing.microsoft.com/) family of neural networks show great success in this.

## Recent AI Research

The huge recent growth in neural network research started around 2010, when large public datasets started to become available. A huge collection of images called [ImageNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ImageNet), which contains around 14 million annotated images, gave birth to the [ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge](https://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/).

In 2012, [Convolutional Neural Networks](../4-ComputerVision/07-ConvNets/README.md) were first used in image classification, which led to a significant drop in classification errors (from almost 30% to 16.4%). In 2015, ResNet architecture from Microsoft Research [achieved human-level accuracy](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2015.123).

Since then, Neural Networks demonstrated very successful behaviour in many tasks:

Year | Human Parity achieved
-----|--------
2015 | [Image Classification](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2015.123)
2016 | [Conversational Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05256)
2018 | [Automatic Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05567) (Chinese-to-English)
2020 | [Image Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13682)

Over the past few years we have witnessed huge successes with large language models, such as BERT and GPT-3. This happen happened mostly due to the fact that there is a lot of general text data available that allows us to train models to capture the structure and meaning of texts, pre-train them on general text collections, and then specialize those models for more specific tasks. We will learn more about [Natural Language Processing](../5-NLP/README.md) later in this course.

## 🚀 Challenge

Do a tour of the internet to determine where, in your opinion, AI is most effectively used. Is it in a Mapping app, or some speech-to-text service or a video game? Research how the system was built.
