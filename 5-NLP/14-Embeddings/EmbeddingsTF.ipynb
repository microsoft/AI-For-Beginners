Also, the **gensim** framework can be used to train the most commonly used embeddings in a few lines of code, as described [in the official documentation](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/auto_examples/tutorials/run_word2vec.html#training-your-own-model)."

To overcome this limitation, we need to build embeddings based on the **language model**, which is trained on a large corpus of text, and *knows* how words can be put together in different contexts. Discussing contextual embeddings is out of scope for this tutorial, but we will come back to them when talking about language models in the next unit.\n"
