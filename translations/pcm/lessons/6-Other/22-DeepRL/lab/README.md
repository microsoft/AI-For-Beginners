# Train Mountain Car to Escape

Lab Work wey come from [AI for Beginners Curriculum](https://github.com/microsoft/ai-for-beginners).

## Task

Your work na to train RL agent wey go control [Mountain Car](https://www.gymlibrary.ml/environments/classic_control/mountain_car/) for OpenAI Environment.

## Di Environment

Mountain Car environment na one place wey car dey trap for valley. Your goal na to jump comot for di valley and reach di flag. Di actions wey you fit do na to accelerate go left, go right, or no do anything. You fit observe di position of di car along x-axis, and di velocity.

## Stating Notebook

Start di lab by opening [MountainCar.ipynb](MountainCar.ipynb)

## Wetin You Go Learn

You go sabi for dis lab say to use RL algorithms for new environment no too hard, because OpenAI Gym get di same interface for all environments, and di algorithms no dey depend too much on di type of environment. You fit even arrange di Python code so dat e go fit pass any environment to RL algorithm as parameter.
