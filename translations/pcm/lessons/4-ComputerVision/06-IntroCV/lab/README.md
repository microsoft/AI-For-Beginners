# Detect Movements wit Optical Flow

Lab Assignment from [AI for Beginners Curriculum](https://aka.ms/ai-beginners).

## Task

Check [dis video](../../../../../../lessons/4-ComputerVision/06-IntroCV/lab/palm-movement.mp4), wey person palm dey move go left/right/up/down for stable background.

<img src="../../../../../../translated_images/palm-movement.341495f0e9c47da39cc1f99626822a1d20203aa33ff89a86a068f14bea133e84.pcm.png" width="30%" alt="Palm Movement Frame"/>

**Your goal** na to use Optical Flow take know which part of di video get up/down/left/right movements.

**Stretch goal** go be to track di palm/finger movement using skin tone, as dem explain [for dis blog post](https://dev.to/amarlearning/finger-detection-and-tracking-using-opencv-and-python-586m) or [here](http://www.benmeline.com/finger-tracking-with-opencv-and-python/).

## Starting Notebook

Start di lab by opening [MovementDetection.ipynb](MovementDetection.ipynb)

## Takeaway

Sometimes, task wey dey look complex like movement detection or fingertip detection fit dey solved just by computer vision. So, e good make you sabi wetin libraries like OpenCV fit do.
