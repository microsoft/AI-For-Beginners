# Human Body Segmentation

Lab Assignment wey come from [AI for Beginners Curriculum](https://github.com/microsoft/ai-for-beginners).

## Task

For video production, like for example, weather forecast, we dey need cut human image comot from camera and put am on top another footage. Normally, dem dey use **chroma key** techniques do dis one, wey be say dem go film di person for front of one background wey get one kind uniform color, den dem go remove di background. For dis lab, we go train one neural network model wey go fit cut di human silhouette comot.

## The Dataset

We go use [Segmentation Full Body MADS Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tapakah68/segmentation-full-body-mads-dataset) wey dey Kaggle. Make you download di dataset manually from Kaggle.

## Stating Notebook

Make you start di lab by opening [BodySegmentation.ipynb](BodySegmentation.ipynb)

## Takeaway

Body segmentation na just one of di common tasks wey we fit do with images of people. Another important tasks na **skeleton detection** and **pose detection**. Check di [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) library to see how dem dey implement dis kind tasks.
