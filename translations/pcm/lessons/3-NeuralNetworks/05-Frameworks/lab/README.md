# Classification wit PyTorch/TensorFlow

Lab Assignment from [AI for Beginners Curriculum](https://github.com/microsoft/ai-for-beginners).

## Task

Solve two classification problems using single and multi-layered fully-connected networks wit PyTorch or TensorFlow:

1. **[Iris classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set)** problem - na example of problem wey get tabular input data, wey classical machine learning fit handle. Your goal na to classify irises into 3 classes, based on 4 numeric parameters.
1. **MNIST** handwritten digit classification problem wey we don see before.

Try different network architectures to get di best accuracy wey you fit achieve.

## Stating Notebook

Start di lab by opening [LabFrameworks.ipynb](LabFrameworks.ipynb)
