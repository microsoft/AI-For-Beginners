## How to use dis repo as e dey

If you wan use dis repo as e dey now, without GitHub Classroom, e still dey possible. You go need tell your students which lesson una go work on together.

For online format (Zoom, Teams, or any other one), you fit divide students into breakout rooms for the quizzes, and mentor dem to prepare dem to learn. Then you fit invite students to do the quizzes and submit dia answers as 'issues' for one particular time. You fit do the same thing for assignments, if you wan make students work together openly.

If you prefer private format, tell your students make dem fork the curriculum, lesson by lesson, to dia own GitHub repos as private repos, and give you access. Then dem fit do quizzes and assignments privately and submit am to you through issues for your classroom repo.
