## Pedagogy

We choose two teaching principles when we dey build dis curriculum: make sure say e dey hands-on **project-based** and e get **frequent quizzes**.

As we make sure say di content align wit projects, e go make di process dey more interesting for students and e go help dem remember di concepts well. Plus, small quiz before class go set di student mind to learn di topic, while another quiz after class go help dem remember am more. Dis curriculum dey flexible and fun, and you fit take am complete or small small. Di projects dey start small and e go dey more complex as di 12-week cycle dey go.

> **A note about quizzes**: All di quizzes dey [for dis app](https://red-field-0a6ddfd03.1.azurestaticapps.net/), e get 50 quizzes wey get three questions each. Dem dey linked from inside di lessons but you fit run di quiz app locally; follow di instructions for di `etc/quiz-app` folder.

## Offline access

You fit run dis documentation offline by using [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/). Fork dis repo, [install Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/quickstart) for your local machine, and then for di root folder of dis repo, type `docsify serve`. Di website go dey served for port 3000 for your localhost: `localhost:3000`. PDF of di curriculum dey available [for dis link](../../../../../../../../../etc/pdf/readme.pdf).
