    "In the BoW representation, word occurrences are weighted using the same method regardless of the word itself. However, it's obvious that frequent words like *a* and *in* are far less significant for classification than specialized terms. In most NLP tasks, some words carry more importance than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TF-IDF** stands for **term frequency - inverse document frequency**. It is a variation of the bag-of-words approach, where instead of a binary 0/1 value indicating whether a word appears in a document, a floating-point value is used, which reflects the frequency of the word's occurrence in the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, the weight $w_{ij}$ of a word $i$ in document $j$ is defined as:\n",

    "w_{ij} = tf_{ij}\\times\\log({N\\over df_i})\n",

    "* $N$ is the total number of documents in the collection\n",
    "* $df_i$ is the number of documents in the collection that contain the word $i$\n",
    "\n",
    "The TF-IDF value $w_{ij}$ increases in proportion to how often a word appears in a document but is offset by the number of documents in the corpus that contain the word. This adjustment helps account for the fact that some words are more common than others. For instance, if a word appears in *every* document in the collection, $df_i=N$, and $w_{ij}=0$, meaning those terms would be completely ignored.\n",
