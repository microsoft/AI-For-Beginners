    "One major limitation of traditional pretrained embedding representations like Word2Vec is the issue of word sense disambiguation. While pretrained embeddings can capture some of the meaning of words in context, all possible meanings of a word are encoded into the same embedding. This can create challenges for downstream models, as many words, such as the word 'play,' have different meanings depending on the context in which they are used.\n",

    "- John wants to **play** with his friends.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pretrained embeddings mentioned above represent both meanings of the word 'play' in the same embedding. To address this limitation, we need to create embeddings based on the **language model**, which is trained on a large corpus of text and *understands* how words can be used in different contexts. While discussing contextual embeddings is beyond the scope of this tutorial, we will revisit them when we talk about language models in the next unit.\n"
